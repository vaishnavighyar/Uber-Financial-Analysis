# Uber-Financial-Analysis

**Description** 

This Analysis aims to evaluate **Uber's financial performance** and assess its financial health by examining key financial metrics and trends.

Here I have Referred SEC reports of Uber from 2015 to 2024.
From the SEC report, I have analyzed Uber's Profit and loss Statements, Balance sheet statements, and Cash flow statements to identify key trends.

I have generated a detailed report on Uber's financial performance using the **'**SWOT - Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats'**** analysis methodology.

This report mainly includes **KPIs** responsible for changes in gross margin, net profit margin, revenue generated, and how the increase in Monthly active platform users (MAPCs) contributes to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margins.
